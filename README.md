Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a native speaker of Turkish and I am fluent in English.

I am heavily interested in retro computing and mobile devices. I am especially interested in Linux (distros) and feature phones. 
I also play drums and I really like photography.
I want to make tech easier for everyone, while not dumbing it down.

I translate open-source projects at Launchpad. You can see me there:

I currently know bit of C++ and Python, my goals are:
- Learning C
- Learning Japanese and Farsi, and becoming proficient in MSA
- Making a tool similar to YaST that works on multiple distrubutions.
